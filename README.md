Consideration of a public response to ABC data collection and sharing

Read a draft letter to the ABC board in [markdown](abc.md) or [Word/docx](ABCData.docx) format.

or [join the discussion](https://github.com/AusOpenTech/ABCData/discussions) on technical options for non-cooperation.

For background reading, you might like to read the ABC's new [privacy collection statement](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001511015-ABC-Privacy-Collection-Statement-) or [privacy policy](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001154976).  Make sure you click on the drop-downs.

For a concrete idea of the data we're talking about, see this capture from @wabzqem: "Current data sent from web player to OzTAM (these types of events are sent regularly throughout playback). They also capture IP." Of course, we don't know how much of this is being retained or shared, but the privacy policy does not give any confidence in this regard.
